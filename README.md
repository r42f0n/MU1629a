INTRODUCTION to COMPOSITION
Fall   Term
Course   Prerequisites:   None,   but   restricted   to   students   enrolled   in   the   Don   Wright   Faculty   of   Music.Please   note   that   prerequisites   are   no   longer   automatically   checked   prior   to   course   registration.   It is   the   responsibility   of   each   student   to   ensure   that   they   have   the   specified   prerequisites.   Unless   you either have   the requisites   for this   course   or special   permission   from   the Dean   to   enroll   in   it,   you   will be   removed   from   the   course   and it will be   deleted   from your record.   This   decision   may   not   be   appealed.   You   will   receive   no   adjustment   to   your   fees   in   the   event   that   you   are   dropped from a course   for   failing to have the   necessary   prerequisites.Course   Description:   Introduction   to   the   elementary   components   of   compositional   technique   involving   pitch and contrapuntal   relationships,   harmonic interactions,   rhythmic   properties, texture,   timbre, architecture and basics of   orchestration. Topic discussions will involve a survey of   musical   examples      drawn      from      the      20th      and      21st          century      literature,      as      well      as      modern      texts      on   compositional, contrapuntal and harmonic technique and their manipulation.Course Outcomes: Students can expect to gain the understanding of   basic compositional concepts   and   become   acquainted   with   the   elements   of an   individual   musical   language.   Students   will   be   introduced   to   the   appropriate   compositional   vocabulary   and   become   familiar   with   the   skills   and   abilities of   describing musical material. They will learn to   manage   compositional   tools   and   apply them to the creation of   their own short-scale compositions and learn how to notate their music and   organize musical matter.Assignments:   Assignments   are   due   at   the   beginning   of   class   on   the   assigned   due   date.   Late   assignments   will   be   accepted   up   to   one   week   past   the   deadline   with   a   5%   penalty   each   day.   Assignments will not   be accepted one week   past the deadline. This   policy will   be strictly enforced.   Only medical emergencies will be considered as a valid excuse.Academic   Offences:   Any   infraction   on   academic   honesty   and   plagiarism   will   not   be   tolerated.   With the ubiquitous use   of   AI   and   ChatGPT, the   course instructor   will   be   on   the   lookout   for   any   work completed by students through the use of   dishonest means. The objective of   this course is to help   students   develop   their   own   artistic   voice,   language   and   vocabulary –   skills   only   obtainable through hard work   and   academic   integrity.   Suspected plagiarism   and/or use   of   virtual   assistance will be immediately flagged and forwarded to the appropriate academic   integrity   committee.Submission of   work with which you have received help from someone else (other than the   course   instructor   or   TA)   is   an   example   of plagiarism,   which   is   considered   a   major   academic   offence.   Scholastic   offences   are   taken   seriously   and   students   are   directed   to   read   the   appropriate   policy,   specifically,       the          definition          of       what          constitutes       a          Scholastic          Offence,          as       found          at:
